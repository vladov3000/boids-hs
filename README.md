## Boids

This program simulates bird flocking by using the classic [Boids algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). The low framerate in the demo video is because GIF is not a good format, the program runs at 60 FPS for screens full of boids locally.

To build the program, ensure you have cabal installed and run `cabal build`. Run `cabal list-bin boids-hs` to get the path to the output binary.
